Hi folks

Welcome to my Currency converter app.

There are currently two branches. In the master branch there is the full app which is using a button to make the conversion happen. In the branch dev there is a WIP version of the converter working without the button, but this version is more of experimental and not finished.

In order to make both versions of this app running, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone desired version's repo.
2. In order to get the server running navigate in terminal to the folder called server and type "npm i" to install node modules.
3. In server folder create .env file and copy provided API and DB keys.
4. Now you can run the server on your localhost with command "npm run dev".
5. In order to get the client running navigate in terminal to the folder called client and type "npm i" to install node modules.
6. Now you can run the client on your localhost with command "npm run dev".
7. That's it.

Happy converting! And remember... convert to currencies, not to religions. :-)
